%description
This stack provides Python bindings for Qt. There are two providers: pyside and
pyqt. PySide is released under the LGPL. PyQt is released under the GPL. Both
the bindings and tools to build bindings are included from each available
provider. For PySide, it is called &quot;Shiboken&quot;. For PyQt, this is
called &quot;SIP&quot;. Also provided is adapter code to make the user's Python
code independent of which binding provider was actually used which makes it very
easy to switch between these.
